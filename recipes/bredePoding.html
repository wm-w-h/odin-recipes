        <li>3/4 C. milk</li>
        <li>1/4 C. heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 egg, or 2 egg yolks</li>

    </ul>

    <h4>DIRECTIONS</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the heavy cream with the milk and add sugar, salt and egg.</li>
        <li>Place in a pot on the stove and cook over low heat until the mixture becomes thick. It is important that you keep the heat low because you don't want your custard to curdle.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, put your round of bread into the bowl.</li>
        <li>When the custard has thickened, pour it through a strainer onto the bread.</li>
    </ol>
